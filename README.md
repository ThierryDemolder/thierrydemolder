 
# My personal site - thierrydemolder.com

# Introduction
The idea behind this project is to create my own site and to add
    my achievement and goals.

# Technologies

    - HTML5
    - CSS3
    - PHP
    - MySql


# Setup

    - I am using hostgator for hosting. I am fairly happy with them so far.
    - Namecheap for the registration of the domain name.
    - I have used VSC as editor.
    - Editing of picture have been done with paint. Though I have a full
        adobe suite licence but have never used it. Training is needed.



# Launch & Status
It is already online (with some mistakes). I will update it regularly + correcting and improving
    the coding in due time.
